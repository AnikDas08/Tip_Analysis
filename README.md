# Tip Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting tips using data from the hospitality or service industry. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and machine learning models to predict tip amounts based on various factors.

## Project Structure

- **`tip analysis.ipynb`**: Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA). It examines trends, correlations, and distributions in the dataset.
- **`Tip_prediction_model.ipynb`**: Notebook implementing machine learning models to predict tip amounts.
- **`tips.csv`**: Dataset containing information such as total bill, tip amount, and customer demographics.

## Features

### Data Analysis
- Insights into relationships between variables (e.g., total bill and tips).
- Identification of key factors affecting tipping behavior, such as:
  - Day of the week
  - Time of day
  - Party size
  - Gender or demographic information

### Machine Learning
- Feature engineering to improve predictive accuracy.
- Implementation of regression models to predict tips, such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Dataset

The dataset (`tips.csv`) includes the following columns:
- `total_bill`: Total bill amount in dollars.
- `tip`: Tip amount in dollars.
- `sex`: Gender of the customer.
- `smoker`: Whether the customer is a smoker or not.
- `day`: Day of the week.
- `time`: Time of day (Lunch/Dinner).
- `size`: Size of the dining party.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
